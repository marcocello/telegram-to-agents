"""Resolve per-topic project roots to working directories.

The ``project_roots`` config maps a topic to a directory the CLI should run
in instead of the shared workspace. Keys are matched in priority order:

1. the human-readable topic name (as shown in Telegram),
2. ``"<chat_id>:<topic_id>"`` — disambiguates equal topic ids across chats,
3. ``"<topic_id>"`` — plain topic id.

Security note: topic NAMES are set by anyone with Telegram's "Manage Topics"
right, so in multi-admin groups a name key can be claimed by renaming an
unrelated topic. Prefer ``"<chat_id>:<topic_id>"`` keys for sensitive roots.
